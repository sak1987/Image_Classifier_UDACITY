 *Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application*



## Overview

*In this project, I will train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers,* *then export it for use in a stand alone application.*





## Objectives

*Implement an image classifier with PyTorch (build and train a neural network on the flower dataset).
Convert the classifier into an application that others can use. The application should be a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line. The first file, train.py, will train a new network on a dataset and save the model as a checkpoint. The second file, predict.py, uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.*

## Software and Libraries


 *This project uses Python & the following libraries:*
 NumPy
 Pandas
 scikit-learn
 Matplotlib
 Seaborn
 PyTorch
 Pillow
 Data


## The dataset is provided by Udacity and is composed by:
- flowers/test: .jpg images for test
- flowers/train .jpg images to train the classifier
- flowers/valid .jpg images for validation
- cat_to_name.json: dictionary mapping the integer encoded categories to the actual names of the flowers

 *This set contains images of flowers belonging to 102 different categories.* *The images were acquired by searching the web and taking pictures.* *The images have large scale, pose and light variations.* *In addition, there are categories that have large variations within the category and several very similar categories.*
