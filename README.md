*Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application*

#### The goal of this project is to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers


#### Software and Libraries

##### This project uses Python & the following libraries:
 NumPy
 Pandas
 scikit-learn
 Matplotlib
 Seaborn
 PyTorch
 Pillow
 Data


#### *The dataset is provided by Udacity and is composed by:*
- flowers/test: .jpg images for test
- flowers/train .jpg images to train the classifier
- flowers/valid .jpg images for validation
- cat_to_name.json: dictionary mapping the integer encoded categories to the actual names of the flowers

#### *This set contains images of flowers belonging to 102 different categories.* *The images were acquired by searching the web and taking pictures.* *The images have large scale, pose and light variations.* *In addition, there are categories that have large variations within the category and several very similar categories.*
